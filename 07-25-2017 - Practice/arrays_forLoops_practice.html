      // 1) Loop through this array and print out the very first character for every name. Your result should be RPMBDRMECKA

      // 2) if completed try creating the below for every name available...
      // Rian begins with a R
      // Pauline begins with a P
      // Miguel begins with a M
      // Bo begins with a B
      // Dustin begins with a D
      // Raimon begins with a R
      // Maya begins with a M
      // Ethen begins with a E
      // Chloe begins with a C
      // Karina begins with a K
      // Angelo begins with a A

      // 3) Finally, suppose our array above has an infinite amount of names within it. Figure out how you would find the last name within our array without knowing the last number. If you figured it out print. "The last person in our array is Angelo"
